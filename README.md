# CS340---Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write code that is easy to maintain and alter, it's best to write line by line, testing frequently, and stick to best practices.  Working like this ensures that if there is an error, you catch it early.  It also ensures your code is clean and readable to others, which makes it easy to maintain.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, it is good to approach everything with logic and calmness.  As issues arise, consult with others and research online.  It is also a good idea to just read over everything to find errors, even the simplest mistake can cause detrimental errors.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists solve problems and make things easier via technology.  It matters because what we are doing is always to help someone and make things easier.  This will help companies like Grazioso Salvare, because our priority is keeping our clients' best interests in mind.
